Protestors took to the streets to demand greater freedom, democracy, human rights, social justice, and regime change. What caused these uprisings? What is their significance? And what are their likely consequences? In an engaging question-and-answer format, The Arab Uprisings explores all aspects of the revolutionary protests that have rocked the Middle East. Historian James Gelvin begins with an overview--What sparked the Arab uprisings? Where did the demands for democracy and human rights come from? How appropriate is the phrase \"Arab Spring\"?--before turning to specific countries around the region. He looks at such topics as the role of youth, labor, and religious groups in Tunisia and Egypt and discusses why the military turned against rulers in both countries. Exploring the uprisings in Libya and Yemen, Gelvin explains why these two states are considered \"weak,\" why that status is important for understanding the upheavals there, and why outside powers intervened in Libya but not in Yemen. Next, Gelvin compares two cases that defied expectations: Algeria, which experts assumed would experience a major upheaval after Egypt's, and Syria, which experts failed to foresee. He then looks at the monarchies of Morocco, Jordan, and the Gulf, exploring the commonalities and differences of protest movements in each. The final chapter discusses the implications of the uprisings. What do they mean for the United States? For Iran? Has al-Qaeda been strengthened or weakened? What effects have the uprisings had on the Israel-Palestine conflict? What conclusions might we draw from the uprisings so far? For anyone wishing to understand the dramatic events in the Middle East, The Arab Uprisings is the place to turn.</p>", "tags": ["A"], "timestamp": "2015-02-14T18:15:08+00:00", "application_id": 16, "title_sort": "MCL0_12"}, {"uuid": "a4ea11a8-3d63-4cae-8301-4427c99ed21f", "authors": ["Jussi Thirteenth"], "pubdate": "2014-09-22T00:00:00+00:00", "librarian": "Michel Leblond", "identifiers": {"m": "o", "i": "s"}, "format_metadata": {"EPUB": {"size": 80473, "path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock_calibre_library_0/Jussi Thirteenth/MCL0_13 (17)/MCL0_13 - Jussi Thirteenth.epub"}}, "last_modified": "2015-02-14T18:16:47+00:00", "publisher": "University of Minnesota", "formats": ["EPUB"], "title": "MCL0_13", "comments": "Smartphones, laptops, tablets, and e-readers all at one time held the promise of a more environmentally healthy world not dependent on paper and deforestation.

Based on a series of con-versations between Metzner and Ram Dass and recorded by psychiatrist and author Gary Bravo, this book describes their initial experiments at Harvard, the experiments after they were dismissed from Harvard, their journeys to India and their reflections on that transformative era. Birth of a Psychedelic Culture is filled with never before published photographs. Luminaries who appear in this astonishing account include: Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, R.D. Laing, Charles Mingus, Maynard Ferguson and William Burroughs, as well as many lesser known personalities. These include convicts, graduate students and Vedantist monks! In addition to reviewing the experiments, the conversations offer vividly-recalled descriptions of particular trips, with profound insights into the nature of hallucinogens and the role they can play in transcending social conditioning. Included in Birth of a Psychedelic Culture are personal commentaries from some of the other players integral to the scene: Peggy Hitchcock, the Mellon Foundation heiress; Dr. George Litwin, Harvard professor and author; Dr. Gunther Weil, psychologist and educator; Dr. Michael Kahn, clinical psychologist and Professor Emeritus at USC, Santa Cruz; poet Dr. Elsa von Eckartsberg; Dr. George Litwin, organizational behavior consultant; Dr. Paul Lee, professor of philosopy and religion, UC Santa Cruz; Dorothy Fadiman, award winning filmmaker; Lisa Ferguson, and many others. No understanding of the history of the sixties could ever be complete without a grasp of the work of Leary, Alpert, and Metzner, the cultural resistance to their experiments, and the way in which psychoactive drug use became a part of contemporary society. </p>\n\n</div>", "tags": [], "timestamp": "2015-02-14T18:20:01+00:00", "application_id": 19, "title_sort": "MCL0_15"}, {"uuid": "e3e66ea8-45fb-4a52-b720-3c195bdae401", "authors": ["Viktor Sixteenth Mayer-Schonberger", "Kenneth Cukier Sixteenth"], "pubdate": "2013-03-04T23:00:00+00:00", "librarian": "Michel Leblond", "identifiers": {"g": "o", "m": "o", "i": "s", "a": "m"}, "format_metadata": {"EPUB": {"size": 406917, "path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock_calibre_library_0/Viktor Sixteenth Mayer-Schonberger/MCL0_16 (20)/MCL0_16 - Viktor Sixteenth Mayer-Schonberger.epub"}}, "last_modified": "2015-02-14T18:21:38+00:00", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt", "formats": ["EPUB"], "title": "MCL0_16", "comments": "<div><p>SUMMARY ARTICLE:\u00a0<a href=\"http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/03/21/31-a-summary-of-big-data-a-revolution-that-will-transform-how-we-live-work-and-think-by-viktor-mayer-schonberger-and-kenneth-cukier/\">http://newbooksinbrief.com/2013/03/21/31-a-summary-of-big-data-a-revolution-that-will-transform-how-we-live-work-and-think-by-viktor-mayer-schonberger-and-kenneth-cukier/</a><br><br>A revelatory exploration of the hottest trend in technology and the dramatic impact it will have on the economy, science, and society at large.<br></p><p>Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape?

This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena\u2014from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books\u2014into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven\u2019t even done yet, based on big data\u2019s ability to predict our future behavior.<br></p><p>In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. <em>Big Data </em>is the first big book about the next big thing.</p><p>www.big-data-book.com<br></p><h3>Amazon.com Review</h3><h4>Amazon Exclusive: Q&amp;A with Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger</h4><p><strong>Q. What did it take to write <em>Big Data</em>?</strong></p><p>A. Kenn has written about technology and business from Europe, Asia, and the US for <em>The Economist</em>, and is well-connected to the data community. Viktor had researched the information economy as a professor at Harvard and now at Oxford, and his book <em>Delete</em> had been well received. So we thought we had a good basis to make a contribution in the area. As we wrote the book, we had to dig deep to find unheard stories about big data pioneers and interview them. We wanted <em>Big Data</em> to be about a big idea, but also to be full of examples and success stories -- and be engrossing to read.</p><p><strong>Q. Are you big data\u2019s cheerleaders?</strong></p><p>A. Absolutely not. We are the messengers of big data, not its evangelists. The big data age is happening, and in the book we take a look at the drivers, and big data\u2019s likely trajectory: how it will change how we work and live. We emphasize that the fundamental shift is not in the machines that calculate data, but in the data itself and how we use it.</p><p><strong>Q. In discovering big data applications, what was your biggest surprise?</strong></p><p>A. It is tempting to say that it was predicting exploding manholes, tracking inflation in real time, or how big data saves the lives of premature babies. But the biggest surprise for us perhaps was the very diversity of the uses of big data, and how it already is changing people\u2019s everyday world. Many people see big data through the lens of the Internet economy, since Google and Facebook have so much data. But that misses the point: big data is everywhere.</p><p><strong>Q. Is <em>Big Data</em> then primarily a story about economic efficiency?</strong></p><p>A. Big data improves economic efficiency, but that\u2019s only a very small part of the story. We realized when talking to dozens and dozens of big data pioneers that it improves health care, advances better education, and helps predict societal change\u2014from urban sprawl to the spread of the flu. Big data is roaring through all sectors of the economy and all areas of life.</p><p><strong>Q. So big data offers only \u201cupside\u201d? </strong></p><p>A. Not at all. We are very concerned about what we call in our book \u201cthe dark side of big data.\u201d However the real challenge is that the problem is not necessarily where we initially tend to think it is, such as surveillance and privacy. After looking into the potential misuses of big data, we became much more troubled by \u201cpropensity\u201d -- that is, big data predictions being used to police and punish. And by the \u201cfetishization\u201d of data that may occur, whereby organizations may blindly defer to what the data says without understanding its limitations.</p><p><strong>Q. What can we do about this \u201cdark side\u201d?</strong></p><p>A. Knowing about it is the first step. We thought hard to suggest concrete steps that can be taken to minimize and mitigate big data\u2019s risk, and came up with a few ways to ensure transparency, guarantee human free will, and strike a better balance on privacy and the use of personal information. These are deeply serious issues. If we do not take action soon, it might be too late.</p><h3>Review</h3><p><strong>\"Every decade, there are a handful of books that change the way you look at everything. This is one of those books.
