        <dc:description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Review&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth of a Psychedelic Culture is the ultimate insiders guide to the genesis, flowering, devastation, and re-flowering of one of the most significant eras of consciousness expansion in U.S. history. Through a series of revealing interviews and first-hand accounts, academic outlaws Ram Dass, Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and company are revealed to be a thoroughly complex bunch funny, poignant, angry, sincere, learned, naÃ¯ve, and impatient for enlightenment. Much to our delighted edification, they broke on through to the other side and, at least most them, lived to tell this unforgettable tale. Synergetic Press has created an attractively produced work worthy of its fascinating subject. It is both stunningly designed and brimming with a wealth of rare, candid photos capturing a daring crusade the grail of which continues to shape our perceptions of reality today. --Scot D. Ryersson &amp;amp; Michael Orlando Yaccarino, co-authors of the international best-seller Infinite Variety: The Life and Legend of the Marchesa Casati and  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely mesmerizing, and difficult to put down, this exciting book expanded and enriched my understanding of how Harvard s legendary psychedelic research team turned on the world, and beautifully preserves this largely unknown information for future generations. Birth of a Psychedelic Culture fills an important niche in the documentation of psychedelic history, and it sparkles with precious insights and illuminating wisdom. --David Jay Brown, coauthor of Conversations on the Edge of the Apocalypse  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth of a Psychedelic Culture reads like a Who's Who of arts and sciences in the sixties. --Bart Brodsky, Open Exchange Magazine &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Product Description&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birth of a Psychedelic Culture, an extraordinary new book, shines a bright light on the emergence of the sixties culture and the experiments with mind-altering substances undertaken by Professors Timothy Leary, Richard Alpert (Ram Dass) and then-Harvard graduate student Ralph Metzner. Based on a series of con-versations between Metzner and Ram Dass and recorded by psychiatrist and author Gary Bravo, this book describes their initial experiments at Harvard, the experiments after they were dismissed from Harvard, their journeys to India and their reflections on that transformative era. Birth of a Psychedelic Culture is filled with never before published photographs. Luminaries who appear in this astonishing account include: Aldous Huxley, Allen Ginsberg, R.D. Laing, Charles Mingus, Maynard Ferguson and William Burroughs, as well as many lesser known personalities. These include convicts, graduate students and Vedantist monks! In addition to reviewing the experiments, the conversations offer vividly-recalled descriptions of particular trips, with profound insights into the nature of hallucinogens and the role they can play in transcending social conditioning. Included in Birth of a Psychedelic Culture are personal commentaries from some of the other players integral to the scene: Peggy Hitchcock, the Mellon Foundation heiress; Dr. George Litwin, Harvard professor and author; Dr. Gunther Weil, psychologist and educator; Dr. Michael Kahn, clinical psychologist and Professor Emeritus at USC, Santa Cruz; poet Dr. Elsa von Eckartsberg; Dr. George Litwin, organizational behavior consultant; Dr. Paul Lee, professor of philosopy and religion, UC Santa Cruz; Dorothy Fadiman, award winning filmmaker; Lisa Ferguson, and many others. No understanding of the history of the sixties could ever be complete without a grasp of the work of Leary, Alpert, and Metzner, the cultural resistance to their experiments, and the way in which psychoactive drug use became a part of contemporary society. &lt;/p&gt;
