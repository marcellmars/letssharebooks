It is Foucault\u02bcs first major work, written in a dazzling and sometimes enigmatic literary style. It also introduces many of the inspiring and radical themes that he was to write about throughout his life, above all the nature of power and social exclusion. History of Madness begins in the Middle Ages with vivid descriptions of the exclusion and confinement of lepers. Why Foucault asks, when the leper houses were emptied at the end of the Middle Ages, were they turned into places of confinement for the mad? Why, within the space of several months in 1656, was one out of every hundred people in Paris confined? Foucault\u02bcs bold and controversial answer is that throughout modern history, madness has meant isolation, repression and exclusion. Even the Enlightenment, which attempted to educate and include the mad, ended up imprisoning them in a moral world. As Foucault famously declared to a reporter from Le Monde in 1961, \u02baMadness exists only in society. It does not exist outside the forms of sensibility that isolate it, and the form of repulsion that expel it or capture it.\u02ba Shifting brilliantly from Descartes and early Enlightenment thought to the founding of the Hopital General in Paris and the work of philanthropists and early psychiatrists such as Philippe Pinel and Samuel Tuke, Foucault focuses throughout not only on the philosophical and cultural values attached to the mad. He also urges us to recognize the creative forces that madness represents, drawing on examples from Goya, Nietzsche, Van Gogh and Artaud. History of Madness is an inspiring and classic work that challenges up to understand madness, reason and power and the forces that shape them. Also includes information on alienation, animal spirits, asylums, Hieronymus Bosch, brain, burning at the stake, Christ and symbolism, classical age, confinement, convulsions, crime, delirium, dementia, dreams, alienation and exclusion, fear, God, hallucinations, hospitals, houses of confinement, houses of correction, hysteria, the insane, lunatics, mania, melancholy, mind, morality, positivism, prisons, poverty, punishment, the Renaissance, the French Revolution, sin, soul, suicide, symbolism, treatments, vapours, venereal disease, water, wisdom, witchcraft, women, work, workhouses, etc.</p>", "languages": ["eng"], "cover_data": [null, null], "toc": null, "thumbnail": null, "db_id": null, "tags": [], "timestamp": "2014-09-07 01:41:56+00:00", "last_modified": "2014-09-07 15:11:06+00:00", "mime": null, "authors": ["Michel Foucault"], "format_metadata": {"EPUB": {"path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock_calibre_library/Michel Foucault/History of Madness (144)/History of Madness - Michel Foucault.epub", "size": 1465355, "mtime": "2014-09-07 15:11:06.733294+00:00"}}, "publisher": "Routledge", "series_index": null, "lpath": null, "user_categories": {}, "spine": null, "title_sort": "History of Madness", "cover": null, "book_producer": null, "manifest": null, "formats": ["EPUB"], "guide": null, "device_collections": [], "identifiers": {"isbn": "9780415477260", "amazon": "0415477263", "google": "pUx_PwAACAAJ", "mobi-asin": "B000UYCPNG"}}, {"rating": null, "author_sort": "Foucault, Michel", "application_id": 145, "pubdate": "2012-04-17 22:00:00+00:00", "series": null, "author_sort_map": {"Michel Foucault": "Foucault, Michel"}, "librarian": "Franz Doren", "publication_type": null, "size": null, "author_link_map": {"Michel Foucault": ""}, "rights": null, "uuid": "bfeb148e-b9ad-4aa9-bb39-089afdb4f57c", "title": "The History of Sexuality, Vol. 3: The Care of the Self", "comments": "<div><p>The Care of the Self is the third and possibly final volume of Michel Foucault's widely acclaimed examination of \"the experience of sexuality in Western society.\" Foucault takes us into the first two centuries of our own era, into the Golden Age of Rome, to reveal a subtle but decisive break from the classical Greek vision of sexual pleasure.

Mr. Malthus suggested that he write down his objections so that they could discuss them point-by-point. Not long after, Thomas returned with a rather long essay. His father was so impressed that he urged his son to have it published. And so, in 1798, appeared An Essay on Population. Though it was attacked at the time and ridiculed for many years afterward, it has remained one of the most influential works in the English language on the general checks and balances of the world's population and its necessary control.

Sochor concentrates on the central issue: Bogdanov's conflict with Lenin. This was the thing which expunged Bogdanov's name from the historical record, and in a way so thorough that the exact nature\nof the conflict has remained obscure.</p>\n<p>Although Sochor touches on the differences between Bogdanov and Lenin in the years before the revolution, the main focus of her study is in the post-1917 period, when the point at issue was the kind of transformations which had to be carried out in the young Soviet state, and the way in which these changes ought to be made. Whereas Lenin held that the Bolshevik party ought to be the sole guiding organisation, Bogdanov believed that the workers themselves ought to be schooled in taking the necessary decisions affecting their lives. Bogandov saw the 'cultural revolution' as the essential means of removing the authoritarian attitudes of the past, and constructing a truly democratic society.</p>\n<p>Lenin was understandably suspicious of Bogdanov's ideas, since they were the antithesis of his own, and took prompt measures to render Proletkult harmless, and to declare Bogdanov's conceptions a deviation from Marxism. He saw to it that it was his own version of the 'cultural revolution' which dominated, one which was more 'an ideology of development', and had more limited and practical objectives. Sochor's study is quite successful in bringing out the differences between Lenin and Bogdanov, and is a valuable addition to the growing literature in English on Bogdanov.\"</p></div>", "languages": ["eng"], "cover_data": [null, null], "toc": null, "thumbnail": null, "db_id": null, "tags": [], "timestamp": "2014-09-07 15:46:50+00:00", "last_modified": "2014-09-07 15:55:13+00:00", "mime": null, "authors": ["Zenovia A.

He was an active revolutionary, a journalist with syndicalist leanings, a metal-worker and trade-union leader, and one of the best proletarian poets. In later years he became perhaps the most important champion of the Taylor system and scientific management in Russia; as the founder and leader of the Institute of Labour (CIT) in Moscow he trained hundreds of thousands of new workers for Soviet industry. In 1938 he fell a victim to the Stalinist terror.</p>\n\n<p>Besides presenting his biography, the present study tries to trace the development of Gastev\u2019s Utopian ideas about the creation of a New Man suited to the industrial society of the future. In his articles and poems the worker is so Intimately fused with machines that he adopts their rhythm and functional movements, himself becoming \u201cmechanical\u201d. One chapter is specially devoted to Gastev\u2019s poetry, the collection Po\u00e9zija rabo\u010dego udara (\u201cThe Poetry of the Factory Floor\u201d). Four prose poems are analyzed in detail. These describe the future development of the proletariat, and also show how Gastev \u2018s manner of writing gradually becomes a kind of \u201cTaylorized\u201d poetry, that has been strongly influenced by futurism.</p></div>", "languages": ["eng"], "cover_data": [null, null], "toc": null, "thumbnail": null, "db_id": null, "tags": [], "timestamp": "2014-09-07 16:00:01+00:00", "last_modified": "2014-09-07 16:07:22+00:00", "mime": null, "authors": ["Kurt Johansson"], "format_metadata": {"PDF": {"path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock_calibre_library/Kurt Johansson/Aleksej Gastev, Proletarian Bard of the Machine Age (154)/Aleksej Gastev, Proletarian Bard of the Ma - Kurt Johansson.pdf", "size": 56778731, "mtime": "2014-09-07 16:00:01.913354+00:00"}}, "publisher": "Almqvist & Wiksell International", "series_index": null, "lpath": null, "user_categories": {}, "spine": null, "title_sort": "Aleksej Gastev, Proletarian Bard of the Machine Age", "cover": null, "book_producer": null, "manifest": null, "formats": ["PDF"], "guide": null, "device_collections": [], "identifiers": {"amazon": "9122006141", "isbn": "9789122006145"}}, {"rating": null, "author_sort": "Marx, Karl", "application_id": 155, "pubdate": "1992-05-04 22:00:00+00:00", "series": null, "author_sort_map": {"Karl Marx": "Marx, Karl"}, "librarian": "Franz Doren", "publication_type": null, "size": null, "author_link_map": {"Karl Marx": ""}, "rights": null, "uuid": "9030f391-7788-43be-b58d-f56ff683743e", "title": "Capital: Volume 1: A Critique of Political Economy", "comments": "<p>This 1867 study\u2014one of the most influential documents of modern times\u2014looks at the relationship between labor and value, the role of money, and the conflict between the classes.</p>", "languages": ["eng"], "cover_data": [null, null], "toc": null, "thumbnail": null, "db_id": null, "tags": ["Economics"], "timestamp": "2013-05-19 22:18:53+00:00", "last_modified": "2014-09-07 17:30:33+00:00", "mime": null, "authors": ["Karl Marx"], "format_metadata": {"EPUB": {"path": "/home/m/devel/letssharebooks/mock_calibre_library/Karl Marx/Capital_ Volume 1_ A Critique of Political Economy (155)/Capital_ Volume 1_ A Critique of Political - Karl Marx.epub", "size": 2761103, "mtime": "2014-09-07 17:30:33.837772+00:00"}}, "publisher": "Penguin", "series_index": null, "lpath": null, "user_categories": {}, "spine": null, "title_sort": "Capital: Volume 1: A Critique of Political Economy", "cover": null, "book_producer": null, "manifest": null, "formats": ["EPUB"], "guide": null, "device_collections": [], "identifiers": {"amazon": "0140445684", "isbn": "9780140445688"}}, {"rating": null, "author_sort": "Gilbreth, Frank Bunker", "application_id": 156, "pubdate": "1919-01-02 00:00:00+01:00", "series": null, "author_sort_map": {"Frank Bunker Gilbreth": "Gilbreth, Frank Bunker"}, "librarian": "Franz Doren", "publication_type": null, "size": null, "author_link_map": {"Frank Bunker Gilbreth": ""}, "rights": null, "uuid": "e16ac3ea-1e7b-4319-8ed0-25c16d3109c9", "title": "Fatigue Study: The Elimination of Humanity's Greatest Unnecessary Waste, a First Step in Motion Study", "comments": "<p>Originally published 1919.: Access to the digital version of this title and other related titles can be found on HEARTH (Home Economics Archive: Research, Tradition, and History) at http://hearth.library.cornell.edu, an electronic collection of core historical titles on home economics.
