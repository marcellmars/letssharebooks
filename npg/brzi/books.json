The times in which bankers and financiers were the primary movers and shakers of both economy and society have come to an abrupt halt. What has this shift meant for the future of capitalism?

What about the lives and careers of financial operators who were once driven by utopian visions of economic, social, and personal transformation? And what does it mean for critics of capitalism who have long predicted the end of financial institutions?

The authors discuss the implications for political decision making in general and describe a \"dialogic\" democracy that enriches traditional representative democracy.

These new, Nobel Prize-winning theories, based on elegant mathematical models of markets, were not simply external analyses but intrinsic parts of economic processes. Paraphrasing Milton Friedman, MacKenzie says that economic models are an engine of inquiry rather than a camera to reproduce empirical facts. More than that, the emergence of an authoritative theory of financial markets altered those markets fundamentally. For example, in 1970, there was almost no trading in financial derivatives such as \"futures.\" By June of 2004, derivatives contracts totaling $273 trillion were outstanding worldwide. MacKenzie suggests that this growth could never have happened without the development of theories that gave derivatives legitimacy and explained their complexities. MacKenzie examines the role played by finance theory in the two most serious crises to hit the world's financial markets in recent years: the stock market crash of 1987 and the market turmoil that engulfed the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. He also looks at finance theory that is somewhat beyond the mainstream -- chaos theorist Benoit Mandelbrot's model of \"wild\" randomness. MacKenzie's pioneering work in the social studies of finance will interest anyone who wants to understand how America's financial markets have grown into their current form.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"An Engine, Not a Camera provides an insightful appreciation of the ways in which financial models influence and shape the world they seek to understand.\" Anthony Hopwood Times Higher Education Supplement</p><p>\"A brilliant, extremely lucid account of the connections between financial economics and the development of futures, options, and derivatives markets between the 1950s and 2001.\" Neil Fligstein American Journal of Sociology</p><p>\" <em>An Engine, Not a Camera</em> is a compelling, detailed, and elegantly written exploration of the conditions in which finance economists help to make the world they seek to describe and predict.

It is not a diatribe against Nassim Taleb's The Black Swan, but criticises the whole background or framework of predictable and unpredictable events - white and black swans alike -, i.e. the very category of prediction.<br><br>In this revolutionary book, Elie redefines the components of the technology needed to price and trade derivatives. Most importantly, and drawing on a long tradition of philosophy of the event, from Henri Bergson, to Gilles Deleuze, to Alain Badiou, and on a recent brand of philosophy of contingency, embodied by the speculative materialism of Quentin Meillassoux, Elie redefines the market itself against the common perceptions of orthodox financial theory, general equilibrium theory and the sociology of finance.<br><br>This book will change the way that we think about derivatives and approach the market. If anything, derivatives should be renamed contingent claims, where contingency is now absolute and no longer derivative, and the market is just its medium. Also, the book establishes the missing link between quantitative modelling (no longer dependent on probability theory but on a novel brand of mathematics which Elie calls the mathematics of price) and the reality of the market.</p><h3>From the Author</h3><p>The current crisis has led us to a conceptual impasse regarding the financial market. No prediction model can apply to the market, someone like Nassim Taleb, author of The Black Swan, would say and derivatives, which are the product of the most sophisticated brand of financial mathematics and engineering, should be banned. I claim that the way of the market falls outside probability and prediction, and for this reason it should be preserved.  </p><p>Probability has to be discarded and a new category has to emerge instead, which will mediate contingency. This new category is something called \"price.\" While probability mediates abstract possibilities, or pure metaphysical fictions, price mediates concrete and real contingencies, which typically take place in a market.   </p><p>Philosophers and financial academics alike seem to be missing the point. Philosophers of contingency and the event are for the most part of leftist obedience. They believe that the crisis signals the end of capitalism and Wall Street.  </p><p>In fact, the market has nothing to do with Wall Street or with the investment banks. Market-making is a creative activity. The market is a category of thought that is independent of ideology. It replaces probability altogether and discarding the market, like the philosophers of the radical change claim we should do, is like discarding probability!  </p><p>As for financial academics, they aren't in the least interested in learning about the onto-genesis of the market, or the very investigation that I have attempted in this book. They deal with prices and values as if they were numbers and mathematical functions. How can they listen to someone who claims that the price only looks like a number but doesn't \"compute\" like one and that one needs to very carefully\u00a0 examine a long thread of philosophy of the event and of contingency, extending\u00a0 from Bergson to Deleuze to Badiou and Meillassoux, in order to understand what's inside a price ?  </p><hr><p>Simplest ideas are sometimes the most revolutionary and, consequently, the most difficult ones. Here is the simple idea that my whole book revolves around: If contingency is truly to be considered absolute (as in Meillassoux), then it should no longer be thought in terms of possibilities (what, in probability theory, we call \"states of the world,\" or in metaphysics, \"possible worlds\"). It should be thought absolutely, independently of any \"system of coordinates\" represented in possibility.  </p><p>In Meillassoux, contingency comes even before existence, before the ontology of existing things, let alone states. I find astonishing that no one seems to be worried about the medium where such contingency-without-possibility, if it must be conceived at all, could be \"represented.\" Not to mention the metaphysics, or even the mathematics, where it could find an expression.   </p><p>It is very hard to think of a contingent thing without representing in mind the possible other things that it might be. Philosophers are trained to form and develop just these kinds of \"impossible\" thoughts. All I am saying is that - with all due respect to the philosophers - this conception of absolute contingency finally finds in the\u00a0 market of contingent claims (and in its translation in the \"mathematics of price\")\u00a0 the adapted category of thought.  </p><p>My point is simply that philosophers might be missing a whole new way of writing philosophy. Just think what the real amazing implications would be if we were truly to start writing and thinking without the idea of probability and prediction! As for the financial and economical experts, they might be missing the opportunity to elevate their field above the level of human or political science.<br>--Book synopsis </p><h3>From the Inside Flap</h3><p>\"<em>The Blank Swan</em> is neither Black, White or Blank, but a very original book written about derivatives and financial markets.

Donald MacKenzie is one of the most perceptive analysts of the workings of the financial world. In this book, he argues that economic agents and markets need to be analyzed in their full materiality: their physicality, their corporeality, their technicality. Markets are populated not by disembodied, abstract agents, but<br>by embodied human beings and technical systems. Concepts and systematic ways of thinking that simplify market processes and make them mentally tractable are essential to how markets function.  </p><p>In putting forward this material sociology of markets, the book synthesizes and contributes to the new field of social studies of finance: the application to financial markets not just of economics but of wider social-science disciplines, in particular science and technology studies.

In <em>Liquidated</em>, Karen Ho punctures the aura of the abstract, all-powerful market to show how financial markets, and particularly booms and busts, are constructed. Through an in-depth investigation into the everyday experiences and ideologies of Wall Street investment bankers, Ho describes how a financially dominant but highly unstable market system is understood, justified, and produced through the restructuring of corporations and the larger economy.</p><p>Ho, who worked at an investment bank herself, argues that bankers\u2019 approaches to financial markets and corporate America are inseparable from the structures and strategies of their workplaces. Her ethnographic analysis of those workplaces is filled with the voices of stressed first-year associates, overworked and alienated analysts, undergraduates eager to be hired, and seasoned managing directors. Recruited from elite universities as \u201cthe best and the brightest,\u201d investment bankers are socialized into a world of high risk and high reward. They are paid handsomely, with the understanding that they may be let go at any time. Their workplace culture and networks of privilege create the perception that job insecurity builds character, and employee liquidity results in smart, efficient business. Based on this culture of liquidity and compensation practices tied to profligate deal-making, Wall Street investment bankers reshape corporate America in their own image. Their mission is the creation of shareholder value, but Ho demonstrates that their practices and assumptions often produce crises instead. By connecting the values and actions of investment bankers to the construction of markets and the restructuring of U.S. corporations, <em>Liquidated</em> reveals the particular culture of Wall Street often obscured by triumphalist readings of capitalist globalization.</p></div>", "publisher": "Duke University", "authors": ["Karen Ho"], "formats": [{"format": "pdf", "file_name": "Liquidated_ An Ethnography of Wall Street - Karen Ho.pdf", "dir_path": "Karen Ho/Liquidated_ An Ethnography of Wall Street (A John Hope Franklin Center Book) (10)/", "size": 1835355}], "cover_url": "Karen Ho/Liquidated_ An Ethnography of Wall Street (A John Hope Franklin Center Book) (10)/cover.jpg", "identifiers": [{"scheme": "isbn", "code": "9780822345992"}, {"scheme": "amazon", "code": "0822345994"}], "languages": ["eng"]}, {"title": "Knowing Machines: Essays on Technical Change (Inside Technology)", "title_sort": "Knowing Machines: Essays on Technical Change (Inside Technology)", "timestamp": "2014-12-29 13:43:54.758287+00:00", "pubdate": "1996-01-01 23:00:00+00:00", "series_index": 1.0, "last_modified": "2014-12-29 14:09:58.491145+00:00", "library_uuid": "dde67a22-8076-4906-b277-564652f90717", "_id": "6176717e-4d01-4162-9b45-4bc57cf3314b", "tags": ["Economics"], "comments": "<div><p>Ranging from broad inquiries into the roles of economics and sociology in the explanation of technological change to an argument for the possibility of \"uninventing\" nuclear weapons, this selection of Donald MacKenzie's essays provides a solid introduction to the style and the substance of the sociology of technology.  </p><p>The essays are tied together by their explorations of connections (primarily among technology, society, and knowledge) and by their general focus on modern \"high\" technology.

But do financial markets really operate in such a straightforward manner? The Sociology of Financial Markets approaches financial markets from a sociological perspective. It seeks to provide an adequate sociological conceptualization of financial markets, and examine who the actors within them are, how they operate within which networks, and under which cognitive and cultural assumptions. Patterns of trading, trading room coordination, cognition and emotions, and global interaction are studied to help us better understand how markets work and the types of reasoning underlying these institutions. Financial markets also have a structural impact on the governance of social and economic institutions. Until now, sociologists have examined issues of governance mostly with respect to the legal framework of financial transactions. Contributions in this book highlight the ways in which financial markets shape the inner working and structure of corporations and their governance. Finally, the book seeks to investigate the symbolic aspects of financial markets. Financial markets affect not only economic and social structures but also societal cultural images and frameworks of meaning. Barbara Czarniawska demonstrates how representations of gender relationships are a case in point. Arguing that financial markets are not simply neutral with respect to questions of gender but enhance certain images and interpretations of men and women. Addressing many important topics from a sociological perspective for the first time, this book will be key reading for academics, researchers, and advanced students of financial markets in Business, Management, Economics, Finance and Sociology.</p><h3>Review</h3><p>`Review from previous edition ...until now sociologists have shown little sustained interest in financial markets.

Codes of Finance takes readers behind the scenes of the equity derivatives business at one of the world's leading investment banks before the crisis, providing a detailed firsthand account of the creation, marketing, selling, accounting, and management of these financial instruments--and of how they ultimately created havoc inside and outside the bank. Vincent Antonin L\u00e9pinay, a former employee of the bank, investigates the journey of a derivative through the bank's front, middle, and back offices. In the process, he provides a rare look at the strange world of quants, traders, salespeople, accountants, and others involved in a self-annihilating form of life in which securities designed by the bank eventually threaten its infrastructure. Throughout, he tries to understand the baffling languages of engineered financial products and the often-conflicting bodies of expertise that are mobilized to create them. Codes of Finance highlights the massive costs of investment banking's hubristic dream of manufacturing global financial services that derive their value from multiple economies across the world. Yet the book challenges simplistic condemnations of financial engineering by showing that derivation is the central operator of economic life--stretching far beyond the phenomenon of financial derivatives themselves. Essential reading for economic sociologists and financial economists, as well as for readers curious to decipher modern finance, this is the first serious study of the intellectual and organizational puzzles raised by the controversial products of contemporary financial engineering.</p>", "publisher": "Princeton University", "authors": ["Vincent Antonin L\u00e9pinay"], "formats": [{"format": "pdf", "file_name": "Codes of Finance_ Engineering Derivatives - Vincent Antonin Lepinay.pdf", "dir_path": "Vincent Antonin Lepinay/Codes of Finance_ Engineering Derivatives in a Global Bank (19)/", "size": 3818484}], "cover_url": "Vincent Antonin Lepinay/Codes of Finance_ Engineering Derivatives in a Global Bank (19)/cover.jpg", "identifiers": [{"scheme": "amazon", "code": "0691151504"}, {"scheme": "google", "code": "zwmRq-xSiOIC"}, {"scheme": "isbn", "code": "9780691151502"}], "languages": ["eng"]}, {"title": "Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge", "title_sort": "Epistemic Cultures: How the Sciences Make Knowledge", "timestamp": "2014-12-29 13:44:02.358068+00:00", "pubdate": "1999-05-29 22:00:00+00:00", "series_index": 1.0, "last_modified": "2014-12-29 13:47:29.141179+00:00", "library_uuid": "dde67a22-8076-4906-b277-564652f90717", "_id": "8b974466-4bbe-43bc-98ad-d7bd33d42ae3", "tags": ["Economics"], "comments": "<div><p>How does science create knowledge? Epistemic cultures, shaped by affinity, necessity, and historical coincidence, determine how we know what we know. In this book, Karin Knorr Cetina compares two of the most important and intriguing epistemic cultures of our day, those in high energy physics and molecular biology.

By looking at epistemic cultures in two sample cases, this book addresses pressing questions about how such expert systems and processes work, what principles inform their cognitive and procedural orientations, and whether their organization, structures, and operations can be extended to other forms of social order.  </p><p>The first ethnographic study to systematically compare two different scientific laboratory cultures, this book sharpens our focus on epistemic cultures as the basis of the knowledge society.  </p><h3>Review</h3><p>[Karin Cetina] has studied the behavior and practices of physicists in the process of trying to acquire knowledge of the basic components of the universe, and of biologists seeking empirical knowledge of natural objects. According to Cetina, the way the two groups go about their business is fundamentally different, and this difference has something to tell us about how we know what we know...A thorough and thoughtful examination of the epistemic underpinning of a knowledge society. (M. H. Chaplin <em>Choice</em>) </p><h3>Review</h3><p>There are many provocative and very interesting things in this book, above all the fairly dramatic and systematic contrast between the working cultures and organizational structures of experimental high energy physics laboratories and molecular biology ones. The opening framework for contrasting these two sciences by their empirical, technological, and social machineries is enormously suggestive. All this should help set a working agenda for anthropologists, sociologists, historians, and philosophers of science and technology of how to explore, elaborate, and expand upon the now often stated proposition that the sciences are diverse in their methods and approaches to the world.

Is good (or bad) financial governance merely the work of legislators and regulators?

While these reforms are often characterized as freeing private markets to shoulder financial risks, <em>Collateral Knowledge</em> persuasively argues\u2014and the global financial crisis confirms\u2014that the legal infrastructure for derivative transactions could not protect private investors from their own folly nor insulate the general public from the consequences of private miscalculation.\u201d</p><p>(Howell E.

Annelise Riles upends current debates about regulation and deregulation, private versus public interest, and financial globalization by calling our attention to the unobtrusive yet pervasive technical devices that private actors use to do their business.

Riles shows how the set of legal techniques and knowledges that constitute collateral is centrally implicated in the practices of global finance and in the ideological discourses promoted by figures from Hayek to De Soto on the privatization of public goods and the substitution of law by arbitration. She unpacks collateral\u2019s technicalities, its position in a network of technocratic rationalities and actions, and its political effects in relation to legal process and understandings of law and state in the financial markets.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>(Bill Maurer, University of California, Irvine)  </p><p>\u201c[A] fresh and thought-provoking perspective. . . . <em>Collateral Knowledge</em> is a worthwhile contribution to the discussion of the global financial crisis and the more democratic path we should forge in its wake.\u201d</p><p>(<em>Harvard Law Review</em>)  </p><p>\u201c<em>Collateral Knowledge </em>surely inspires difficult thinking about private law and financial regulation, using collateral in derivatives markets as a complex and interesting context.\u201d</p><p>(Heather Hughes <em>Journal of Law and Commerce</em>)  </p><p>\u201cRiles, an expert on East Asia (and on Japan in particular), has spent years talking with Japanese finance lawyers and bureaucrats, and observing their activities.
